Woke up at 6

Did backyard work and then showered

Had to pick up my dad from car service

Riya came home around 11, so spent like 30 minutes with her. Avni and Riya left to like show her around san jose and waste and for some fricking reason they didnt invite me. So, instead I just was sitting on my desk doing japanese work and like 1 hour in realizing they left, I was like "bruh this bish". Then I took a nap, cuz I was tired, so I played my cope music and napped for a little under an hour. Worked on more japanese work and then watched joy luck club movie. the movie was kinda depressing, but at the end was heartwarming. 

Worked on college waste

now im here kay.

"i cant wait for college apps to be over so all the people who have been obsessing with college apps for their whole lives can finally touch grass and realise how much happiness they wasted by worrying about how everything they did will impact their ability to get into a "elite" college"
